            <h2>Lance's Story</h2>I adopted Lancelot in September 2022. Someone had abandoned him in the woods by my mom's house, and it took us about two weeks to get him to come inside. Once he did, he quickly adopted me as his person and we have been inseparably ever since. </p>
	    <p>Lancelot is an incredibly snuggly cat. He loves people and wants to be around someone all the time. He also enjoys catnip, playing with his toys, and (when it's warm enough) going outside for a walk on his leash. He has a special travel backback so I can take him on trips, but he doesn't particularly like it.</p>
	    <p>Lancelot has many nicknames, including Lance, Lancey, Lancey Pants, Handsome Lansome, Lanceloaf, and simply The Boy™️. He's a big cat at almost 16 pounds, and he lets me pick him up and carry him around. His favorite place to be is on my lap.
